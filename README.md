# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

**My postmortem: **

During the first phase of building this interesting project, I was not using html semantics but I later did which is something interesting I found doing. It is a good thing to build website that is not only beautiful and functional but accessible for everyone.

Another interesting thing is paying attention to detail during development.  Alot of great developers thinks they can just do things their own way but paying attention is very crucial at some point. Give your customers the freedom to choose and advice instead of forcing them to use what you give them.

Lastly, I am a very busy person and my schedule is always occupied but I have to find the time to do this interesting task.  The task is simple but kind of complex in my own opinion. Form management can be tricky in cases where no design library is needed. 

Thank you for reading.
